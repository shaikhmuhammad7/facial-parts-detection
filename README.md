# Facial Parts Detection using OpenCV

This program uses the Viola-Jones algorithm and is trained to detect a frontal face and its features. The intuition is that it takes a grayscale image as an input and then looks for certain facial features with the Haar-like features. After that, the OpenCV library draws a rectangle over the image or video input it receives from a user's webcam. After the algorithm detects a single facial feature, it expands upon it and looks for other specific features within the face.
